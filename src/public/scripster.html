<p>Try and share scala code, using the Scripster, by <a href="http://www.razie.com">Razvan Cojocaru</a>. See the <a href="http://wiki.homecloud.ca/scripster">guide</a>, <a href="http://razie-scripster.962791.n3.nabble.com/">forum</a> or brush up on your <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1305">scala</a>.
<p>The current version is built on scala 2.8 and includes scalaz 5.0
<ul>
<li>refresh page to get a new "session"
<li>F9 - runs current line
<li>CTRL+F9 runs the current selection
<li>CTRL+SPACE for content assist
</ul>

<p>Known issues:
<ul>
<li>the first content assist may be slow and may not produce a result, take a deep breath, count to 5...and do it again...
<li>works fine on chrome and firefox and apparently IE8... IE7 caches somehow the ajax requests and doesn't play nice
<li>sessions expire in about 2-3 minutes and there's max 10...memory ain't cheap
<li>there should be no interaction between sessions...but, this is not fully tested yet.
</ul>
