<ul>
<li>refresh page to get a new "session"
<li>F9 - runs current line
<li> CTRL+F9 runs the current selection
<li>CTRL+SPACE for content assist
</ul>

<p>NOTE that there isn't much security here and clients can get access to pretty much anything :)

<p>Known issues:
<ul>
<li>the first content assist is slow and may not produce a result, take a deep breath, count to 5...and do it again...
<li>there's no feedback when content assist is empty...
<li>works fine on chrome, looks ugly on IE and doesn't work onfirefox...is this my fault or theirs?
<li>sessions expire in 7 minutes and there's max 10...memory ain't cheap
</ul>
