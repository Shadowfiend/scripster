<p>Scripster user guide is available at <a href="http://wiki.homecloud.ca/scripster">http://wiki.homecloud.ca/scripster</a>

<p>NOTE that there isn't much security here and clients can get access to pretty much anything :)

<p>To customize this notice, put a "/public/scripster.html" in your classpath. An empty file should eliminate this (good in swing).
