<ul>
<li>refresh page to get a new "session"
<li>F9 - runs current line
<li>CTRL+F9 runs the current selection
<li>CTRL+SPACE for content assist
</ul>

<p>NOTE that there isn't much security here and clients can get access to pretty much anything :)

<p>Known issues:
<ul>
<li>the first content assist is slow and may not produce a result, take a deep breath, count to 5...and do it again...
<li>works fine on chrome and firefox. DOESN'T work on IE as far as i can tell - it caches somehow the ajax requests and doesn't play nice
<li>sessions expire in about 2-3 minutes and there's max 10...memory ain't cheap
<li>there should be no interaction between sessions...but, this is not fully tested yet.
</ul>
