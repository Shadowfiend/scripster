<ul>
<li>refresh page to get a new "session"
<li>F9 - runs current line
<li>CTRL+F9 runs the current selection
<li>CTRL+SPACE for content assist
</ul>

<p>Known issues:
<ul>
<li>if you encounter any issues, please refresh the browser (F5) - that will create a new session. You will loose the contents of the pad, so it would be a good idea to copy them beforehand.
<li>sessions expire in about 2-3 minutes and there's max 10...memory ain't cheap
<li>there should be no interaction between sessions...but, this is not fully tested yet.
