What's this?
------------
Interactive scripting pad for scala. It is available over telnet, http and swing.

Why?
----
So anyone can interact with a running application, having access to all the application's objects. Obviously, we don't want 'anyone' to have this kind of access, so you will no doubt take steps to protect this.

Details
-------
The code is generally self-documented. Keep your eyes out for package.html and similar stuff.


Roadmap
-------
May add some more scripting languages in the future but otherwise I don't think this will evolve.

It may also get nicer.
